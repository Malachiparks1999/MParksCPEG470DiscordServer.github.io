Personal Growth Report
EMAIL REPORT TO: your_udel_username@websec.prof.ninja

I want to know about your growth. Even if the project is a group project I want each person to tell me the following:

    What is your project?
    Give me step by step instructions to get it running. (This might involve sharing execute ability on a cloud9 space with 'AndyNovo'.)
    Who did you work with? If part of a group, how would you describe your role?
    How many hours did you work on this?
    List your "a-ha" moments. (When something useful clicked for you.)
    What parts of your project do you wish to improve? How many hours do you estimate your improvements will take?
    What is your overall impression of the experience? Which skills do you want to keep in your future?
