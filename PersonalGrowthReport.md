## PERSONAL GROWTH REPORT QUESTIONS ##
    1. Describe the timeline of the project: HOW MANY HOURS DID YOU SPEND, when did you start, bottlenecks you faced, etc.
    2. How did you meaningfully grow as a developer from the project (if you did)?
    3. Were there any "A-HA" insights that you'll carry with you into future work?
    4. If you collaborated with other folks in the class what was that like?
    5. Are you proud enough of the work that you'd use it in a job interview/portfolio? If not, what would you change to make it that way?
    6. Rate your sense of mastery on a scale of 1-10 for our mastery tasks for this project:
       a. You can host a website using static files on a CDN
       b. You can display data read from a database dynamically
       c. You can write data to a database (and have other users see it)
       d. You can manage client-side "routing", "deep-linking", and display different screens based on the user's choices
       e. You can design your database (or API services) to give you what you need on the screen you need it
       f. Given an array of JSON objects display them each in a template and let a user interact with any particular object
       g. You can setup OAuth and passwords with email resets for your users
       h. You can assign roles to users based on their auth token and control access based on those roles
       i. You can allow users to create a new server/channel/page dynamically and others route to that synthetic page

## Explanation ##

![How I feel after this project](images/CurrentEmotions_Ifunny.jpg)

Before I answer the questions for the questions for the Personal Growth Report I need to ramble about how I feel about this project. I personally believe this is the worst thing I have created. In my not so humble opinion I have created a dumpster fire held together by ductape ie spaghetti code. Its not because this project was "impossibly hard" just I fell into my usual time management trap where I didn't work on it for a week or so because I got pulled in 10 directions between work, my advanced software engineering class (another hard time --- had to fix a broken website and client wanted it done now), along with other items.  

*TLDR: This is not my best work - I can produce better work if I gave myself more time and restarted rather than patching onto existing flawed code*

**1. Describe the timeline of the project: HOW MANY HOURS DID YOU SPEND, when did you start, bottlenecks you faced, etc.**

> *__Hours Spent:__* 70 hrs minimum </br>
> *__Started:__* Roughly when the project was assigned - so September 15th maybe? </br>
> *__Bottlenecks:__*
>   * Changing snipets of code causing everything to break
>   * Firebase JSON rules (Didn't realize how they were formatted at first)
>   * Not knowing a lick of Javascript (had to teach myself) </br>

> *__Timeline:__*
>   1. *Week 1:* Learning Javascript
>   2. *Week 2:* Learning HTML + CSS Selectors
>   3. *Week 3:* Firebase CRUD to push chats + HTML Setup + base CSS
>   4. *Week 4:* Login Screen + Firebase OAuth
>   5. *Week 5:* Sidetracked on other work
>   6. *Week 6:* Reformatted Messages + Rendering + Started editing messages (Not done)
>   7. *Week 7:* Editing Messages + Admin Accounts + Channel Creation

**2. How did you meaningfully grow as a developer from the project (if you did)?**

> I barely have done any developer work with creating projects - my goal has to been to delve into developer work more.
> This project has shown me it's okay to produce junk to refine your skills and to eventually build a secure masterpiece.
> Yes, you will be discouraged but push through it --- developers before you and to come will have the same issues to face.

**3. Were there any "A-HA" insights that you'll carry with you into future work?**

> * Lets objects handle their own domain - don't need to track all information if I don't want to
> * Be comfortable with parsing --- will be doing more of this
> * Never worked with Javascript/HTML/CSS --- will be taking this and want to learn more about it
> * JQUERY   --- figured out how this works and i'll want to use this more in coding
