## PERSONAL GROWTH REPORT QUESTIONS ##
    1. Describe the timeline of the project: HOW MANY HOURS DID YOU SPEND, when did you start, bottlenecks you faced, etc.
    2. How did you meaningfully grow as a developer from the project (if you did)?
    3. Were there any "A-HA" insights that you'll carry with you into future work?
    4. If you collaborated with other folks in the class what was that like?
    5. Are you proud enough of the work that you'd use it in a job interview/portfolio? If not, what would you change to make it that way?
    6. Rate your sense of mastery on a scale of 1-10 for our mastery tasks for this project:
       a. You can host a website using static files on a CDN
       b. You can display data read from a database dynamically
       c. You can write data to a database (and have other users see it)
       d. You can manage client-side "routing", "deep-linking", and display different screens based on the user's choices
       e. You can design your database (or API services) to give you what you need on the screen you need it
       f. Given an array of JSON objects display them each in a template and let a user interact with any particular object
       g. You can setup OAuth and passwords with email resets for your users
       h. You can assign roles to users based on their auth token and control access based on those roles
       i. You can allow users to create a new server/channel/page dynamically and others route to that synthetic page

![How I feel after this project](images/CurrentEmotions_Ifunny.jpg)

Before I answer the questions for the questions for the Personal Growth Report I need to ramble about how I feel about this project. I personally believe this is the worst thing I have created. In my not so humble opinion I have created a dumpster fire held together by ductape ie spaghetti code. Its not because this project was "impossibly hard" just I fell into my usual time management trap where I didn't work on it for a week or so because I got pulled in 10 directions between work, my advanced software engineering class (another hard time --- had to fix a broken website and client wanted it done now), along with other items.  

*TLDR: This is not my best work - I can produce better work if I gave myself more time and restarted rather than patching onto existing flawed code*
